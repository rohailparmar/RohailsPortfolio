                <p>During my tenure with the Texas A&M Rocket Engine Design team, specifically within the Avionics Subteam in Fall 2023, I have had the privilege of contributing significantly to the design and functionality of our rocket engine's main valve stepper motor control.</p>

<p>My primary contribution involved the design and simulation of an asynchronous stepper motor program. This critical component was directly connected to a valve within the internal fluids' system, utilizing a Nema 23 Bipolar stepper motor in conjunction with a 2-Phase Digital Stepper Driver. This setup was integral in controlling the flow and management of internal fluids critical to the engine's operation.</p>

<p>A key aspect of my role was to understand and implement a sophisticated PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control system. This was achieved through the use of a Teensy microcontroller, which I programmed in C++ to ensure precise control over valve operations. This task not only demonstrated my technical proficiency but also my ability to tackle complex control systems that are vital for the precise operation of rocket engines.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have honed my skills in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design, becoming proficient with KiCad software. My ability to create detailed system architecture diagrams has played a pivotal role in streamlining complex setups. This skill has significantly enhanced system reliability by providing clear and concise representations of our designs, facilitating easier understanding and implementation.</p>

<p>These accomplishments underscore my dedication and technical expertise within the Avionics Subteam, contributing to the overarching goal of advancing rocket engine design through innovative solutions and meticulous attention to detail.</p>
